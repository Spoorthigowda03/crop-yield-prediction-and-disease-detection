#### crop yield prediction:The project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to forecast crop yields accurately by analyzing sequential data like weather patterns and soil conditions. 
 
#### disease detection:Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to detect and classify crop diseases from leaf images, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop losses.
