#### Crop yield prediction: The project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to forecast crop yields accurately by analyzing sequential data like weather patterns and soil conditions.

#### Disease detection: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to detect and classify crop diseases from leaf images, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop losses.
